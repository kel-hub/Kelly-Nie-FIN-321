## **Instructions:**
**Scenario:** 
You will be presented with a scenario in which your firm expects to receive a foreign-currency payment (e.g., EUR, JPY, GBP) on a specific future date. Exchange rate volatility could affect how much your company ultimately receives.

**Include:**
1) What the exposure is (currency, amount, timing).  
2) Why it’s risky (what could go wrong for USD proceeds).  
3) Three hedge families with quick pros/cons for each hedging strategy.  
4) Next steps (what analysis you’ll build in Stages 2–3).
    - **Technical Specification:** a *quantitative plan* for a spreadsheet model.
    - **Excel Model Build:** Implement your spec into a *basic .xlsx model*.
    - **Prompt Engineering:** Write a prompt that, given inputs, asks an AI to generate the spreadsheet matching your spec.
    - **Final Analysis & Recommendation:** Choose a hedge using your model.

**Deliverable:** One page (PDF or Markdown).  
**Tone:** Executive-friendly and clear.  
**Due date:** October 24
