## A. Exposure Summary
The firm expects to receive €8.0 million in one year from a European customer. Because our functional currency is USD, the company is exposed to the EURUSD exchange rate risk. If the euro depreciates over the next year, the USD value of the receivable will decline, directly reducing reported revenue and operating cash flow. Given the size of the exposure and its certainty in timing and amount, unmanaged FX volatility could introduce material earnings variability and complicate budgeting and liquidity planning.

## B. Summary of Hedge Outcomes
We analyzed three hedging strategies: the forward contract, money market hedge, and currency options. The forward hedge ensures certainty by locking in a fixed USD value, completely mitigating FX risk. The money market hedge effectively mimics the forward contract by borrowing euros, converting at spot, and investing USD proceeds, providing similar economic outcomes. Option hedges introduce asymmetry; a EUR put protects against euro depreciation but allows for potential gains if the euro appreciates, while the less suitable EUR call serves as a benchmark. Notably, options incur an upfront premium, potentially decreasing expected USD returns unless significant euro movement occurs.

## C. Sensitivity Interpretation
In the case of EUR depreciation, both forward and money market hedges offer complete protection for USD cash flows, ensuring a consistent outcome regardless of the extent of the euro's decline. However, while put options can also provide some level of protection, they only do so below a specified strike price, and the overall USD return is diminished by the premium cost associated with acquiring the option.

When the euro appreciates, the forward and money market hedges miss out on potential gains, as they maintain fixed proceeds. In contrast, put options in a strengthening euro scenario enable investors to benefit from favorable foreign exchange (FX) movements, thereby partially offsetting the premium cost whenever the euro rises. Thus, the choice between hedging strategies hinges on the anticipated movements of the euro, with each strategy presenting distinct advantages and drawbacks in different market conditions.

Key Trade-off
- Forward/MM hedge: Maximum certainty, zero flexibility
- Option hedge: Flexibility and upside, but at a known upfront cost

## D. Strategic Recommendation
Given the firm's objectives and exposure characteristics, the most suitable strategy for the firm is the forward hedge. This conclusion is based on several key factors: Firstly, the amount of receivables and the timing of their realization are highly predictable, which contributes to a reliable risk management approach. Secondly, the company's main goal is to ensure cash flow stability rather than engaging in foreign exchange speculation, making the forward hedge a strategic fit. This method offers the highest level of certainty regarding the USD proceeds from the receivable, all while requiring no upfront cash outlay. 

In comparison, the money market hedge does not provide any economic benefit over the forward hedge and complicates the balance sheet. Alternatively, while options could be considered in cases where management desires the potential for upside gains or where there is an acceptable level of cash flow variability, they are not warranted in this transaction. The associated premium costs for options surpass any potential advantages they might offer, leading to the decision that a forward hedge is the most effective solution in this scenario.

## E. Executive Justification
From a senior management perspective, the forward hedge effectively aligns with the firm's financial and operational priorities by ensuring budget certainty through locked-in USD proceeds, stabilizing cash flow by eliminating downside risk from adverse foreign exchange (FX) movements, and providing liquidity efficiency without upfront premiums or margin requirements. Its straightforward structure promotes simplicity and transparency, while also facilitating accounting predictability, particularly when aligned with hedge accounting treatment. Overall, it represents a disciplined risk management solution consistent with best treasury practices and a low tolerance for earnings volatility.
