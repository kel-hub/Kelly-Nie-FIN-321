## Executive Summary (≤150 words)

We expect to receive €8,000,000 in one year from a European customer. Because we report in U.S. dollars, the final value of that payment depends on the future EUR/USD exchange rate. Today the rate is about 1.0850, but if the euro weakens by next year, the amount of dollars we receive will fall. This could reduce our revenue by over $500,000. If the euro strengthens, we would receive more, but that outcome is uncertain. To manage this risk, we will compare three hedging strategies: a forward contract to lock in a set rate, a money market hedge to create a synthetic lock-in, and a put option to protect against losses while keeping upside potential.

## Background & Objectives
Our exposure is due to a foreign-currency receivable due in a year. Current spot and forward rates for EUR/USD are 1.0850 and 1.0890, respectively. Without hedging, exchange rate fluctuations could reduce U.S. dollar proceeds, impacting projected revenue. Our goal is to protect USD cash flows from volatility while evaluating the cost, complexity, and flexibility of different hedging approaches.
