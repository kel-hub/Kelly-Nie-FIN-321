## Executive Summary (≤150 words)

We expect to receive €8,000,000 in one year from a European customer. Because we report in U.S. dollars, the final value of that payment depends on the future EUR/USD exchange rate. Today the rate is about 1.0850, but if the euro weakens by next year, the amount of dollars we receive will fall. This could reduce our revenue by over $500,000. If the euro strengthens, we would receive more, but that outcome is uncertain. To manage this risk, we will compare three hedging strategies: a forward contract to lock in a set rate, a money market hedge to create a synthetic lock-in, and a put option to protect against losses while keeping upside potential.

## Background & Objectives
Our exposure is due to a foreign currency receivable in a year. Current spot and forward rates for EUR/USD are 1.0850 and 1.0890, respectively. Without hedging, exchange rate fluctuations could reduce U.S. dollar proceeds, impacting projected revenue. Our goal is to protect USD cash flows from volatility while evaluating the cost, complexity, and flexibility of different hedging approaches.

## Methods
A forward contract will allow us to secure a set dollar amount today for the future euro payment, removing uncertainty we may have about the final conversion rate. A money market hedge creates a similar outcome by using borrowing and investing activity that aligns with the timing of the receivable. We will also review a put option on euros, which offers protection against a weaker euro but allows gains if the currency strengthens. To compare these approaches, we will create a spreadsheet model that calculates projected dollar proceeds under different future EUR/USD outcomes, incorporating the euro amount, today’s spot and forward rates, relevant interest rates, and the option cost. Through this analysis, we aim to recommend the most effective hedge to protect our revenue.

## Limitations & Next Steps
We acknowledge that market rates, premiums, and interest rates may shift before execution, and that transaction costs or counterparty risk are not fully captured in our initial model. Our next step is to finalize the spreadsheet model, run multiple exchange rate and premium sensitivity scenarios, and then present our recommendation to the CFO. We will evaluate which hedge strategy best aligns with our risk tolerance and cost objective.
