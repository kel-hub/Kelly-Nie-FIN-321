# Stage 5 – Final Analysis & Recommendation (6 Points)
**Due:** December 12, 2025

## Goal
Deliver a polished, executive-ready memo or slide deck summarizing your hedge analysis and recommending the best strategy. This combines quantitative rigor, interpretation, communication, and forward-looking perspective — exactly what senior finance leaders expect from analysts.

**Hint:** Think of this as just another step ("final analysis memo prompt") and have your LLM generate the output based on your **Stage 4 - Spreadsheet**.
